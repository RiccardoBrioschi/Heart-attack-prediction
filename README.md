# Heart-attack-prediction
The project, carried out in R, consists in creating a linear regression model based on the choice of some significant covariates. The dataset was taken on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset). The goal was to create a model able to predict the onset of heart diseases and the final model was then validated using cross validation.
